# Auto solver

I have not finished making the auto solver.
Progress: My current algorithm "sees" adjacent pipes and knows when the field of pipes is completed correctly,
 but is lacking a solution that solves it.
I will keep trying to complete it in my free time.

# Used Technologies

-   TypeScript;
-   React;
-   SCSS;
-   Jest;

# React Style

-   React functional components;


# Level passwords:

1 level - JustWarmingUp;

2 level - DefinitelyWarm;

3 level - DNF;

4 level - DNF;

5 level - DNF;

6 level - DNF;

# Known limitations of your solution:

Levels 1 and 2 have no issues.
Level 3 loading time is on the slow side, but still playable.
Starting from level 4 games loading times are too slow.

# Key design decisions made, especially if you considered multiple options:

I chose to replace individual pipes with simple pictures instead of highly detailed ones, I found out that simple design is better for UX.
